# The most expensive card we are willing to buy.
# (We might in theory end up paying a little more than this, if a card
# is cheaper at some vendor, but it isn't optimal to buy from that vendor.)
# Omit if you are always willing to buy at market price.
MaximumPrice = 200
# Minimum total amount required to buy from a particular vendor.
MinimumPurchase = 200
